## TODO

- Finish refactor:
  - move graph, generate, responders, solver into own packages
  - resolve use of global variables
  - DRY it up
  - abstract handler logic into own class/methods
- API
  - endpoint to generate. should respond with time took, file size, etc.
  - responses for when a graph isn't generated
  - 9 letter words

##### Possible features
- allow word file uploads
- much better graph endpoints, ability to find disconnected subgraphs, etc etc.
